The technique is a time management method that involves doing focused work for 25 minutes without distractions and taking a 5 minutes break afterwards. The process is repeated four times, after which a long break of 20 minutes is taken. This completes a circle of the pomodoro technique. You can have as many circles as you want to have. This is a desktop GUI application built for the pomodoro technique using the python programming language, it has a simplistic and intreresting User-Interface, allowing you to study or work for as long as you want to while the timer counts for you. It also has a statistic button that allows you know how long you have studied/worked for. With more developments to come I introduce you to the pomodoro timer v1.0</p> <p>Language: Python</p> <p>Principal packages: TKinter, OOP, Json</p> <p>Link: pomodoro_timer_project</p>"},{"location":"heart_disease_prediction_project/readme/","title":"Predict Heart Disease","text":""},{"location":"heart_disease_prediction_project/readme/#the-project","title":"The Project.","text":"<p>In 2019, there was about 56 million deaths throughout the year and one single class of disease caused about 32% of these deaths, claiming around 17 million lives. This same class of disease is the leading cause of death in America and caused 1 in every 5 deaths in 2022. These terrible killers are cardiovascular diseases, generally known as heart diseases. Using dataset from 4 databases across Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach I created and trained a model to predict heart disease given the required inputs. It has shown an incredible accuracy of almost 90%, this has the capability and possibility to  detect heart disease before it's too late, saving a ton of lifes in the process. The model was trained using an ensemble algorithm, RandomForestClassifier to be precise.</p> <p>Language: Python</p> <p>Principal packages: scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas</p> <p>Link: heart_disease_project</p>"}]}
